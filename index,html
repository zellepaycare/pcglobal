  <p class="paragph">PayPal is one of the world's largest online payment systems, allowing individuals and businesses to securely transfer funds electronically. It operates in over 200 countries and supports transactions in 25 currencies. Beyond basic money transfers, PayPal offers several additional services and products:
</p>

<br>
<p class="paragph">PayPal Credit provides a reusable credit line built into your account, letting you pay for purchases over time. The PayPal Prepaid Mastercard is a reloadable prepaid card linked to your balance that can be used anywhere Debit Mastercard is accepted. PayPal also offers gift cards that can be added to your wallet or exchanged for cash via third-party services.
</p>
 <br>
  
  <p class="paragph">The PayPal Debit Card (Cash Card) has no annual fee, monthly fees, or cash access fees at MoneyPass ATMs. As a security practice, PayPal will never charge you to enter your password unless you're on their official login page. For micropayments under $10, PayPal charges 5% + $0.05 per transaction, higher than Stripe's 2.9% + $0.30 rate. However, PayPal's global reach spans over 200 countries compared to Stripe's presence in over 30 countries currently.
</p>

<br>
<p class="paragph">PayPal provides seller protection policies that can cover eligible items if they are not received by the buyer or are significantly different than described. Buyers are also protected against unauthorized transactions and item non-delivery. PayPal's Purchase Protection program covers eligible items in case they don't arrive or don't match the seller's description.

</p>
 <p class="paragph">
For businesses, PayPal offers tools like invoicing capabilities, payment tracking, virtual terminal software to accept payments over the phone, and integration with popular ecommerce platforms. Nonprofits can also take advantage of discounted rates when using PayPal to receive donations.

</p>

<br>
 <p class="paragph">
Originally founded in 1998, PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion before being spun off again as an independent public company in 2015. As of 2022, PayPal reported having over 429 million active accounts across more than 200 markets. It processed $1.25 trillion in total payment volume that year.
